Steps for Data stream problem

1. I Create a class DataStream and inside constructor i take an empty dictionary name last printed in which i add last timestamp of data string

2. defined a function should_output_data_str that accept timestamp and data_string that will be pass while calling the function.

3 Intial we check if data_string and its timestamp present or not if not , i take (-5) value as initial value for t+5 condition

4. We take a condition subtracting the last timestamp from current timestamp so if same string with timestamp less than 5 sec consider as false.
