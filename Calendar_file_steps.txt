Calendar file steps

1. The first problem was in the file it check for node.start <= self.end: due to which double booking occuring as if another node start is less than current end then definately it double book.

2. After this condition it try to add under right child instead of left child if value is less we need to add in left sub tree of BST.


3 Similary for second condition it check node.end >= current node start due to which again double booking occur we need to check node.end <= current node start.

4. After this condition also it try to add in left child but it need to add in right child as it is greater.


Solution


1. In first conditon i check node.end < = self.start so that we determine this event is before the current start time and then i added it in left child as it is before.

2. In Second condition i check node.start >= self.end so that we determine the event is after the current event time and then i added it in in right child at is after.
